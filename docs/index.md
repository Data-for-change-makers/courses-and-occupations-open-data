# Data Model and Serializations

The following describe the conceptual data model and how it can be serialized as JSON-LD with JSONSchema providing validation:
 - [Conceptual Schema](conceptualSchema) with mapping to RDF.
 - [Data serialization as JSON-LD](jsonDataSerialization)

The following code supports the implementation of the data model:
- [JSON-Schema files](JsonSchema/) that can be used to validate data serialized at JSON-LD.
- [Sample data](Samples/) in JSON-LD.
- [context.json](context.json) which maps JSON to the RDF terms.
- [context-quals.json](context-quals.json) which provides a couple of qualification types for testing.
