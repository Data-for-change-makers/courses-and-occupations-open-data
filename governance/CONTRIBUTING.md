# Contributing to the project

Contributions of all kinds are welcomed and encouraged.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of types of contribution:

* Data mappings
* Data
* Software code
* Documentation
* Example data

## Licensing and copyright
All contributors retain ownership of their contributions; by
contributing to the project they are granting a non-exclusive,
non-revocable license to the project to use the material they 
have contributed.

Depending on the type of contribution, the license used may 
vary:

* For contributions of software code, a permissive open-source license
* For contributions of documentation, a creative commons attribution license
* For contributions of data, an open data license

## Contributor license agreement

As contributions may vary in license, this can create a problem
when making the outputs of the project available to users;
to mitigate this the project may require a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) from the contributor to enable the project
to make decisions about how the composite of contributions
can be subsequently licensed for outbound use.

## How to make a contribution
To make a contribution, the simplest method is to create a
post on the project discussion board, either including the
contribution inline or as an attachment. Include with the
contribution your copyright and license header.
