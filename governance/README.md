# Governance models

## Without a legal entity

The simplest way to set up an open collaborative project is without creating a separate legal entity.

The project has a defined set of roles, a governance model based on typical open source models such as
'benevolent dictatorship' or 'meritocracy', but as it does not constitute a legal entity is does
not 'own' any intellectual property; all contributions are owned by their contributors and licensed
to the project in such a way that they can be used in an open manner.

## With a legal entity

The main difference between a project with a legal entity and one that does not, is with regard to intellectual
property; a project backed with a legal entity such as a foundation or company can own copyright. 
If the project intends to create content that is not openly licensed, then a legal entity may be required.

The other major difference is that a legal entity can receive and disburse funding.

## Governance model: what does it need to cover?

A governance model needs to define a set of rules and/or guidelines that cover the key topics related
to management of the project. 

This includes:

* What are the `roles` of project members and contributors?
* How are roles allocated to individuals?
* How are decisions made in the project?
* How can materials be contributed to the project?

## The 'rule of two feet' and 'freedom to fork'

If a project strictly follows an open licensing model for all contributions, there is an inherent
mechanism to enforce project cohesion: anyone can take the existing content of the project and 
create a 'fork' under a new form of governance. This is the 'freedom to fork' or 'rule of two feet'
in action: if the way the project is being managed is problematic for contributors or users, they
aren't 'stuck with it'.

This also means that if the project 'outgrows' a simple governance model, then transition to 
a more formal structure such as a foundation or managed process is easy to accomplish.
